## Getting Started

To get started clone the repository. Afterwards the environmental veriables need to be set. The `.env.sample` shows all neccessary variables.

### Development

To make the frontend work, additional environment variables need to be set. A `.env.sample` can be found in the frontend folder. Normally all APIs should be available under `localhost` and their corresponding ports.

To start the development environment run

```bash
./start-development.sh
```
